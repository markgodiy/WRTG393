## Discussion Topics

You will respond to two discussion topics:

1. **Discussion 1** The first discussion topic asks you to complete various exercises designed to help you become familiar with UMGCâ€™s library OneSearch interface.

2. **Discussion 2** The second discussion topic asks you to examine a website for PARC principles.

- Proximity, Alignment, Repetition, and Contrast (PARC) are four principles of design that you will use in writing assignment #2.

- **Promixity**: Items that are related to each other should be grouped together. When several items are in close proximity to each other, they become one visual unit rather than several separate units. Elements that are related logically should be close together physically.

- **Alignment**: Nothing should be placed on the page arbitrarily. Every item should have a visual connection with something else on the page. Aligning elements allows them to create a visual connection with each other or a heireirchal organization to various grouped elements . Alignment consists of both visible and invisible lines that connect different objects. Nothing on a well-designed page should look randomly placed.

- **Repetition**: Repetition strengthens the unity of a design by tying together otherwise separate parts. Repetition can be achieved through repeating some aspect of an element such as a color, shape, texture, spatial relationship, or line thickness. [video link](https://www.screencast.com/t/6Z2Z2Z2Z)

- **Contrast**: Contrast is the juxtaposition of opposing elements (opposite colors on the color wheel, or value light / dark, or direction - horizontal / vertical). Contrast allows you to emphasize or highlight key elements in your design. [video link](https://www.screencast.com/t/6Z2Z2Z2Z)
